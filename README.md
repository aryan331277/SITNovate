Problem statement: DA01


SALES FORECASTING FOR RETAIL:


Predict future sales using time_series analysis (ARIMA, Prophet) on historical data. Identify trends and seasonal patterns for inventory planning.

 Data Collection  - 

 
Data collection is done from the Kaggle dataset - 


https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/retail-sales-data/code


That initially contained around 20 Million records.


DATA PREPROCESSING: 


Outliers detection and removal:


The dataset choose had (19_454_838, 13) records and after outlier detection we have (12_560_367, 13) records.



Heatmap and removal of missing values:




From this heatmap we can see that there are certain irrelevant columns, thus the irrelevant columns are removed. The columns removed are as follows: 

'promo_type_1', 'promo_bin_1', 
    'promo_type_2', 'promo_bin_2', 
    'promo_discount_2', 'promo_discount_type_2'

And now we will work on ARIMA, ML and Data visualisations.

Round 2:

Data Preprocessing was done so shifted towards predictive analysis and data visualization.

Figures 1-6 represent visualised data

Started using Prophet


Created 2 datasets and forecasting predictions for them one is for big data and one is small data

Time 8:00 pm
